        "description": "We're looking to bring on a high-level PPC specialist or small team to manage and grow our paid ad campaigns. We currently have two Google Ads campaigns live and are preparing to launch e-commerce feeds and local lead-gen campaigns for our SEO clients. This is a long-term partnership opportunity with H^ongoing^H work, not a one-off setup.\n\nOur agency serves a mix of local service-based businesses and e-commerce brands. We also operate a white-label division, so some of the PPC work may be under NDA or require branded communication under our partner agencies. You\u2019ll be fully supported by our internal team and given clarity on objectives, but we need someone who is proactive, results-driven, and communicates consistently.\n\n\ud83d\udd27 What You'll Be Doing:\nAudit and optimize existing PPC campaigns (2 active accounts)\n\nSet up and manage Google Shopping and Google Merchant Center\n\nBuild and manage e-commerce product feeds\n\nLaunch and manage local lead-gen campaigns with small budgets for phone call conversions\n\nImplement and manage display network and retargeting strategies\n\nProvide weekly updates and performance reports\n\nWork collaboratively with our SEO, design, and strategy team\n\nStrategize and propose improvements for scaling results and ROI\n\nPossibly manage Facebook/Instagram Ads if experienced (optional but preferred)\n\n\u2705 Required Expertise:\n\nGoogle Ads Certified (Search, Display, Shopping, Retargeting)\n\nExperience with Google Merchant Center and product feed optimization\n\nProficient with conversion tracking, UTM parameters, and lead attribution\n\nStrong understanding of local search ads, call-only ads, and lead gen targeting\n\nAbility to create and maintain custom audiences and remarketing funnels\n\nConfident with tools like Google Tag Manager, GA4, and Adzooma (or similar platforms)\n\nExperience with Shopify or WooCommerce product syncs\n\n\ud83d\udd01 Optional but Preferred:\nFacebook/Instagram Ads experience (Meta Business Suite, Pixel setup)\n\nKeyword tracking tools (SEMrush, Ubersuggest, or similar)\n\n\ud83d\udce3 Communication Is Everything:\nWe cannot stress this enough. We\u2019ve worked with a lot of PPC freelancers, and poor communication is the #1 dealbreaker. You must:\n\nBe proactive and responsive (ideally within 24 hours)\n\nProvide weekly reports and clean client-facing summaries\n\nBe comfortable joining weekly or bi-weekly Zoom calls with our team\n\nExplain campaign strategies and results in clear, non-technical terms when needed\n\nCoordinate with our SEO and web dev team for landing page improvements and messaging\n\nWe\u2019re a very collaborative team. If you\u2019re great at what you do but disappear for days at a time, this won\u2019t be a fit. But if you\u2019re confident in your craft and enjoy being part of a growing, forward-thinking agency, you\u2019ll love working with us.\n\n\ud83c\udf0d Location Preferences:\nWe\u2019ve had our best experiences working with freelancers from:\n\nRomania\n\nSouth Africa\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nEastern Europe\n\nApplicants from these areas or those with 4\u20136 hours of daily overlap with US Eastern Time will be given priority.\n\nWe\u2019re not looking for the cheapest, we\u2019re looking for the most capable and communicative.\n\n\ud83d\udcb5 Budgeting and Rates:\nWe\u2019re open to:\n\nFlat-rate monthly retainers for campaign management\n\nTransparent scope of hours or deliverables included in management fees\n\nWe understand setup and onboarding take more time and are happy to structure a ramp-up accordingly. But we need predictability when it comes to H^ongoing^H management pricing.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf To Apply, Please Include:\nA quick summary of your experience with similar clients or agencies\n\nExample campaigns you\u2019ve managed and the results (brief summaries are fine)\n\nHow you prefer to communicate with clients and report progress\n\nYour pricing structure: flat monthly, H^hourly^H, or hybrid\n\nYour location and availability, including time zone overlap with EST\n\nAny certifications or tools you use regularly\n\nWe\u2019re ready to hire immediately for the right person and move into onboarding and account access within days. If you\u2019re a clear communicator, a strategic thinker, and confident in your ability to help us scale our ad efforts the right way, we\u2019d love to talk.",

We are seeking a driven Land Dispositions Specialist to join our team and play a crucial role in achieving our ambitious growth goals. This fully-remote project management position starts out full-time 30-40 hrs/wk. You'll play a key role on our highly collaborative and close-knit team and will have potential for upward mobility within the company. (No real estate license required).\n\nWe\u2019re currently hiring only from Latin America, Egypt, or candidates who have previously lived or worked in the U.S. to ensure strong alignment with our U.S.-based seller and buyer communication flow.\n\nWe are incredibly proud of the high standards and values we hold our company and staff to, and in order to be a fit on our team, you must be prepared to work hard, seek personal and professional growth opportunities, go above and beyond to meet and exceed goals, and be hungry to make a splash in the off-market land real estate industry.\n\n\nAbout The Role\n\nThe Land Dispositions Specialist is a key member of our Dispositions Division, which is the inventory and \u201cselling\u201d side of our business. In this role, you will manage our inventory of vacant land to be sold, with the primary goal of getting each property \u201cacross the finish line\u201d (sold), so our sellers and investors get paid on time.\n\nThis role is NOT a sales role, but rather, a project management and customer success manager role. Think of it like [project manager skillset] in a [transaction coordination environment] with a [customer success manager flare]. A \u201cTransaction Coordinator +\u201d (TC+), really. You\u2019ll work closely with our acquisition team and help manage our inventory of signed properties, coordinate listings, initiate title work, and own all due diligence and closing coordination tasks.\n\nYou will replace the founder in many tasks and must be proactive, detail-oriented, and committed to following SOPs and improving them.\n\nWe have 31 properties in inventory currently, and we recently added the infrastructure for 20-30 new properties/H^month^H to be added to our inventory, which you will manage.

Having LinkedIn Sales Navigator is a bonus as well.\nI have several projects right now that require MANUAL data mining and entry from LinkedIn (or via ZoomInfo browser extension).  \nThe scope of work varies a little for each client, but from a high level, the work is the same - based off of either a list I provide to you, or a list I instruct you to build, you would scrape certain contact information for all the records and input it into a CSV.  I need someone that is fluent in English and very responsive and can get work done quickly.\nThis is a REVENUE SHARING partnership where I pay you WEEKLY a % of the revenue I bring in.  This is NOT a scenario where I will pay you H^hourly^H, or pay you for collecting X number of records, this is a revenue sharing partnership.  I will do screen shares with you and provide FULL VISIBILITY on how many sales are made so you can see everything, see the below example.\n\nRight now I have a client and last week I made 14 sales, you can see this in a screen share.  But I need a data mining partner to help me build an excellent calling list.  For this project, I would pay you $25 for each sale, so if we had been working together on this project and you built the calling lists that allowed me to make 14 sales, then you would have made $350 for the week just for that client.  Again I will have several clients going at once and these projects will be indefinite.  \n\nIn some cases, based on the complexity of the work, you will receive more than $25 per sale, it all just depends on the complexity of what you are having to do to build my calling lists each day.\n\nIf you have ZoomInfo, LinkedIn Sales Navigator and a team of people that can do the work, let's jump on a screen share and get to work, I have an immediate need for your services!",

A mission. A message rooted in ancient wisdom, designed to heal modern men and restore them to their true design. We are transforming marriages, rebuilding families, and awakening men to live as Kings\u2014not by the world\u2019s standards, but by biblical design.\nThis role will be the architect and executor of a high-volume, high-impact short-form content engine. You will take the deep revelations and soul-awakening truths within our brand vault and translate them into bite-sized content that speaks directly to the soul of a man.\nWe will be producing over 1,000 pieces of content per H^month^H at full capacity. This includes 150+ short-form videos to each be posted for Reels, TikTok, Shorts, and more\u2014plus tweets, carousels, image quotes, and static posts designed to build an ecosystem of transformation across all major platforms.\n\nCore Responsibilities\n1.

Strategic Intelligence & Platform Analysis\n-Conduct weekly competitive research to monitor the content strategies of other top men\u2019s brands, influencers, and coaches.\n-Reverse engineer the most successful short-form content from peers and industry leaders\u2014identify what\u2019s working, why it\u2019s working, and how we can improve it.\n-Analyze funnels, content flows, platform strategies, and email nurturing systems from competitors to sharpen our overall content ecosystem.\n\n\n4. Campaign Planning & Execution\n-Collaborate with Blake and our CMO to build content calendars and strategic initiatives around launches, promotions, and program milestones.\n-Infuse each post with purpose. Whether it\u2019s pointing to a lead magnet, warming the audience for a program, or creating a viral moment\u2014it all ties into the larger vision.\n-Play a key role in connecting content output with our marketing funnel, ensuring that every content piece serves a broader goal of impact and conversion.\n\n\n5.

That means no freelance work or side gigs\u2014we\u2019re looking for someone all-in.\n\n#2 We only hire long-term. If you\u2019re looking for a quick 12-H^month^H gig, this won\u2019t be the right fit. We\u2019re building legacy, not launching a temp project.\n\n#3 For us to collaborate in real-time, it\u2019s important that you align with our work schedule\u2014\n9am-6pm CST. \n\nWe\u2019re in the trenches daily, pushing hard and moving fast, and we need someone who is present, responsive, and fully immersed in the mission. I also own an investment firm and my time is limited, so when I need to speak to a team member, video calls right then are paramount for speed and to remove bottlenecks.\n\nTo align for expectations: \nThis is a 160-hour per H^month^H role (full-time), and we\u2019re offering $6-7/hr as a starting rate, with strong performance-based bonus incentives. For example, within 12 months, it would be possible to earn an additional $6/hr on top of base pay, based on performance, contribution, and alignment with our vision.\n\nBut more than the money, we\u2019re offering something most companies can\u2019t:\nA seat at the ground floor of a world-changing movement. A culture where your work directly contributes to transforming broken families, healing marriages, and restoring men to their God-given identity.\nIf you\u2019re excited by the idea of being a vital part of a team that is storming the gates of hell and setting men free worldwide\u2014while mastering your craft and growing in responsibility\u2014then this may be your calling.\nLet me know if this resonates with you. We\u2019d love to explore if this is a divine fit.\n\n\nWhat You\u2019re Stepping Into\nYou\u2019re not joining a company\u2014you\u2019re joining a movement.\nA movement that is raising men back to their God-ordained identity. A mission that doesn\u2019t just change timelines\u2014it changes legacies. This is your opportunity to help lead that charge through the most powerful medium of this age: short-form content with eternal purpose.\nIf you want to be part of a high-performance team on the frontlines of global men\u2019s transformation, this is the place.",

It isn\u2019t clear such places really existed, but there is enough art to recreate their style :)\n\nI have created a design document with a description of the room including photographs I like of each feature of the room. First I want conceptual sketches in Photoshop or Illustrator (or another) format that express your interior design ideas. Once we refine and arrive at a look and feel, I want a precise 3D SketchUp model and renderings of the final design that I can give to a decorator to recreate the design in my next home.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1P-Hntiea2NJZDO1F1ADP7dQE19Pb4cuHk9wr-fMPtkw/edit?usp=sharing\n\nDesign influences are from Orientalist painting of the near east in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Ottoman Empire, China, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt and the Levant. Everything in the room is to be deep red / maroon, except perhaps for a few yellow, gold or silver accents. I\u2019m open to ideas for other colors to include but overall it should be dark and maroon.\n\nI want a low maroonOttoman couch along two walls, big maroon pillows, maroon tufted pleather walls, a Moroccan lamp that casts patterns of light hanging from an oval, deep blue recess in the ceiling simulating with LEDs a starry sky at dusk, a recessed flatscreen TV in a wall opposite the couch, 2-3 dark, hardwood wooden bookshelves, a red or maroon hookah, a table equipped with an opium tray with Chinese pipe, lamp and tools. I have photographs I like of all of these things to guide you in my vision for the room.\n\nWhile I have a vision for the room, you will have creative freedom within the specifications. Impress me with your ideas\u2026 we can try more than one concept and iterate! I am not a designer but I did took a series of design classes in school that mean I recognize and appreciate good design. I have experience with a dozen projects collaborating with a design team to create logos, marketing materials, user interfaces and websites. I know how to work with a designer to define a vision and let the designer use their creative capacity to make something amazing.
